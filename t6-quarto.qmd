# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.

## Load Libraries and Data

In script `01_load_data.R` we load the `palmerpenguins` package and clean it.

First five rows of the cleaned datset:

```{r}
# show the first 5 rows of cleaned data
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("data/penguins-cleaned.csv")
head(data, 5)
```

# Methods

In script `02_methods.R`, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Summary Statistics
```{r}
# show the summary statistics
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("output/summary_statistics.csv")
data
```

## Boxplot
![Boxplot](output/boxplot.png){#fig-boxplot}


# Model

In script `03_model.R`, we prepare the data for modeling, then fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.

# Results

In script `04_results.R`, we evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset.

## Confusion Matrix

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

- Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
